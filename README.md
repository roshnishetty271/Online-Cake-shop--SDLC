***TITLE: WEBSITE FOR ONLINE CAKE SHOP***

ABSTRACT: We have designed an online cake shop that allows users to check for various cakes available and purchase them online. The website consist of list of cakes displayed in various categories. The user may browse through these items as per categories .User has also option for ordering customised cakes according to their requirements like cake’s flavour size, shape and so on. Thus the website for an online cake shop brings the entire cake shop online and makes it easy for both buyer and seller. It contains login page for admin as well as users. Registered users can purchase cakes directly or by adding it to cart.  

***SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE PHASES:***

Phase 1: REQUIREMENT GATHERING PHASE

We want to design a website which is user friendly and visually appealing to the user at the same time. Requirements are one of the most vital pieces in ensuring the success of the system. The process of finding out what the user requires from the software is achieved from the requirement gathering phase. Hence, we have gathered some data from a number of people which will help us understand and design the website.
The main method which we have used for gathering requirement is through Surveys  which will allow us to collect information from many people in a relatively short amount of time.
We have taken a survey of people of different age group with the help of Google forms and have considered their choices.



In this survey, we keep the record of gender and age of the person to keep a basic track of the general preference.

We found out what interface do they generally prefer while browsing through a website, its layout and design of the website.

Phase 2: INITIAL DESIGN PHASE

Tools: Pen and Paper

Keeping in mind the stakeholders suggestion of different age group collected from previous requirement gathering phase we have designed a user friendly website from website where buying cakes according to user’s need can be performed without any hassle.
We kept the UI simple hence allowing the users to perform easy navigation within website.
Only the essential amount of detail is shown in website in a very neat and clean way.









Following is the initial design we referred while designing our website:

Analysis of Testing Phase:
We have covered stakeholders from age group of 20 to 72 with more than 50% people finding our website as user friendly and simple UI that is aesthetic and appealing at the same time.
More than 60% users have agreed that website provides sufficient information about cakes as well as for placing order.
Most of them seem to be happy with the design of login and sign up page.
50% users think that all the necessary information has been listed on admin page.

Improvements after testing:
As per the suggestions received from stakeholder:
1. We will change the colour scheme of Cart page.
2. Some mentioned the need to provide the information whether the cake is eggless or not so we will include that.
3. Alignment of headings will be kept same in all webpages.
4. We will provide the users with the options of toppings they would love on their cake
 
CONCLUSION:
We collected the stakeholder’s requirements in initial phase and built the website accordingly. Before actually designing the prototype we created initial designs and henceforth we created the actual website using high fidelity prototype. And then usability testing was done in order to gain valuable suggestions of our stakeholders and tried to incorporate those changes thus successfully completing the 4 phases of designing a website.
